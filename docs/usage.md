## Usage
after you finished installing `sky` all you have to do is visit the url `/admin` to manage the Letters, and `/blog`.

> you can configure the URL from the config file, 

check the configuration section for more details

if you don't have a user, or it's a fresh installation of laravel, you can use the command to create a new user
```bash
php artisan make:filament-user
```
