## The concept:

### Form:
The main component of all of this. Including all descriptive texts and the form options.

### Sections:
To group the fields, it has some options like columns number.
Also, an option to display sections as pages or wizards, or tabs

### Fields
fields are fields, most of the common types are available, and you can create custom ones

### Categories:
It's a way to organize and display the forms in the front end.
Any form not linked to a category won't be listed in the forms list at the front end.

### Collections:
Collections are datasets used for lists like checkboxes and select menus.

### Responses:
Every submission has a response record per user.
You can view the responses per form in three ways:
- list: list the response only as cards
- browse: how the response with the fields one per page
- report: table view for all entries and their fields

### Responses Fields:
Fields are related to each response and each field of the form. And they contain the user input.

This structure helps to query any reports you want with ease.
